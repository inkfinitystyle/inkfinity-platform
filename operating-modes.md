# Inkfinity Platform – Operating Modes

This document defines how the Inkfinity Platform is used at different stages
of the business lifecycle.

validation, refinement, and proof-of-use are gathered.

## Key Principle

The Inkfinity Platform is not released based on technical readiness alone,
but on confidence in customer outcomes.

Deliberate gating is a strategic decision, not a technical limitation.
