# Onboarding – Inkfinity Platform

This folder defines how a business is onboarded into the Inkfinity Platform.

The onboarding flow is designed to:
• Collect only essential information
• Reduce friction for non-technical users
• Feed clean, structured data into automation and AI logic

## Core Idea
A business should be able to complete onboarding in under 5 minutes and receive a usable digital hub almost immediately.

## Next Steps (to be built)
• Onboarding questions structure
• Data schema (what we store)
• Automation triggers
• AI-assisted link suggestions
